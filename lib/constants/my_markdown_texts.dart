# Lambda Calculus Simulator

Originally created as a project for the Models of Computation and Type Systems for Programming Language modules at Imperial College, this simulator is a web application that allows users to simulate the execution of a Lambda Calculus expression as well as doing basic type inference.

This Web APP uses the [lambda_calculus dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/lambda_calculus) to do the heavy lifting.
